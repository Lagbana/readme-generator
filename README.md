## Description
README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README doc from a user's input. The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.<br/><br/> This tool will help to easily and quickly generate of a good project README doc so developers spend more time working on their project and less time creating a markdown file.<br/>The application source code is available to everyone under the standard `MIT license`.
